# What for
This repo is for CCW users who want to make and test their own extensions.
# How to jump in
There are two ways to develop and test your extensions.
## Normal remote extension (for anyone)
You can build your blocks and test them. You can use all JavaScript capacity to do what you want. There is only one limit: normal remote extension should be run in a sandbox and unable to access vm or runtime utility.
## CCW approved extension (for CCW collaborator)
As a CCW collaborator, you can push code into this repo. Extensions in this repo will have full access to vm and runtime utility that allow you to build highly functional blocks for all CCW Creators. When you complete testing, you can apply publish extensions to CCW Extension Library. All CCW Creators can use them in their projects.

For example
```
https://www.ccw.site/creator?extension=https://ccw-user-extension.ccw.site/example/normal-ext.js
```
Extensions will be added to the bottom of block menu if there is no error in your code.
### CCW approved extension

Push code and a bot will deploy your commit to a http server automatically. The URL is like below.

The automatic deploy url format is like below
```
https://ccw-user-extension.ccw.site/${your_folder}/${jsFile}
